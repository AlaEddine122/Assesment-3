          <h4>Geographical Location</h4>
          <p>The capital of Algeria's Boumerdès Province is Boumerdès, (originally Rocher Noir). It is situated on the Mediterranean sea.
            A seaside city called Boumerdès is located in northern Algeria, 50 km east of Algiers and 50 km west of Tizi Ouzou. 
            The name of the city under the French occupation of Algeria was Rocher Noir, which translates as Black Rock in English.</p>
          <h4>The french strike</h4>
          <p>Algerian War, commonly known as the Algerian War of Independence, was a conflict between Algeria and France that lasted from 1955 until 1962. 
            The fight for independence started during World War I (1914-18), and it gained traction following World War II when France had promised Algeria greater autonomy 
            but had not followed through on those pledges (1939-45). 
            In order to create an autonomous Algerian state, the National Liberation Front (FLN) started a guerilla war against France in 1954 and requested diplomatic recognition at the UN. 
            The most intense fighting occurred in and around Algiers (including the city of boumerdes), where FLN fighters launched a series of violent urban attacks that became known as the Battle of Algiers. 
            Although Algerian fighters operated in the countryside, particularly along the country's borders, this is where the majority of the fighting took place (1956-57). 
            Only via violent means were French forces, who had increased to 500,000 soldiers, able to regain control.</p>

          <h4>The 2003 Earthquake Strikes</h4>
          <p>In 2003, Northern Algeria was shaken by the 6.8 Mw Boumerdès earthquake, which had a maximum Mercalli rating of X. (Extreme). 
            Over 2,200 people lost their lives, over 10,000 were hurt, and ships at the Balearic Islands were sunk by a moderate tsunami. The city was absolutely destroyed. People lost their homes,
            they Algerian government was aiding to the best of its capabalities, however, the extent of the damages were too much.</p>
          <p>Eventually, with the help of the community as well as the help of the government, the city was rebuilt,
            apartment buildings were back up, and it had become a city even better than it previously was.
            It now serves as the district of Boumerdès's capital city. 
            The University of M'hamed Bouguerra and other national institutes were built, 
            and they have given the city a name for being a hub for science. Institutes such as Institut Algérien du Pétrole (IAP), 
            Faculté des Hydrocarbures et de la Chimie (FHC), Institut National d'Électricité et d'Électronique (INELEC), 
            Institut National de Génie mécanique (ENGM), and Institut National des Industries légères (The National Institute for Light Industries INIL) were developed and began to enroll students,
            making them experts in science fields.
            The city is now also renowned as an industrial hub, housing the corporate offices of Sonatrach Exploration, ENAGEO, and the Centre de Recherches et de Développement 
            (Research and Development Center for Sonatrach CRD).</p>
